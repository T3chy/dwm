# Elam(Actually mostly Luke Smith)'s build of dwm

## What's special about my fork?
- use modkey + J and modkey + K to switch focus from one monitor to anotehr
- use modkey + L and modkey + H to send the selected window to the other monitor!
kinda vim like ish lol

## Please install `libxft-bgra`!

This build of dwm does not block color emoji in the status/info bar, so you must install [libxft-bgra](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libxft-bgra/) from the AUR, which fixes a libxft color emoji rendering problem, otherwise dwm will crash upon trying to render one. Hopefully this fix will be in all libxft soon enough.
